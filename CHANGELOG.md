## [May 15, 2025]

### âœ¨ Added
- **Project folder structure** based on Maven standard:
  - Included folders: `model/`, `view/`, `controller/`, `data/`, `utils/`
  - Added placeholder class files to match planned components (`Plant`, `User`, `Reminder`, etc.)
- Created initial **JSON data plan** for static plant information:
  - Watering frequency, sunlight needs, plant category, temperature range
- Began **Figma UI Design**:
  - Designed minimalist layout for main dashboard, plant list, and journal screen
  - Ensured compatibility with Java Swing's layout limitations

### âœ… Changed
- **Updated project timeline** to accommodate **Database Integration**:
  - Week 2: Setup SQLite DB structure (tables for users, reminders, journals)
  - Week 3: Implement read/write between database and application logic
  - Week 4: Test interactions between JSON (static data) and database (dynamic data)
  - Clearly separated responsibilities: static data (JSON), dynamic user data (Database)
- Improved overall data structure plan:
  - Plant JSON file will be used only for read-only plant references
  - User inputs (selected plants, reminders, journals) will be stored in the database

### ðŸ§  Discussed
- Clarified the role of the **controller** package in MVC:
  - Handles logic between model and view (e.g., user events, data validation)
- Explained where to store the JSON data file (in `/resources` or `/data` folder)
- Strategized GitHub commits:
  - Agreed to commit project structure early to enable version tracking even before coding starts
